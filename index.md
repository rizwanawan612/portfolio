## 🧩 Design / Layout Enhancements

Here are some ideas to polish the visual design:

1. **Add a Navigation Bar**  
   Create a `_includes/navbar.html` (or use theme features) and include links to “Home”, “Projects”, “Publications”, “Contact”.

2. **Profile Photo or Header Banner**  
   Add an image file in your repo (e.g. `assets/profile.jpg`)  
   In the top of page insert:  
   ```html
   <img src="/portfolio/assets/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Photo" style="width:150px; border-radius:50%;">
